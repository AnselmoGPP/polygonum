Good practice:

	Bug: If I don't move, chunks may not appear ever.
	Chunks rendering based on distance makes no difference between chunks types (see planet from afar).
	Don't render chunks if [out of cam view angle (fov)] / [you don't move camera]

	DynamicGrid::chunks requires lookup and delete elements. Is there a better DS for this than std::map?
	PlanetGrid::isVisible & modelOrdered & fullyConstructed & inModels necessary?
	Chunks don't empty their buffers after construction of Model. However, this is useful for grass positioning.

	Waves:
		Sea chunks borders doesn't fit due to waves.
		Maybe, the more normal and sun light align (or cam dir), the more green water is.
		Green with height
		Black shadows when waves are too sharp (bad normals)
		Transparent when close, opaque when far / Transparency near cost / Transparent water & darked terrain)
		Foam specularity & roughness in the limit is evident
		Holes in axes zone / Spherical sea: Hole in waves origin (vertex displacement)
		> Gaps problem: Waves are computed for middle vertices too.
		Reflections
		Sea has to know about ground. Thus, sea+ground has to be passed to shader. Thus, both have to be calculated at the same time. Thus, dynamicGrid changes are required.

Less important:

	Study implications of using square distances in shaders
	Analyze std::hash (vertex.hpp)
	Optimize radius calculation (like just calculating sqrt(radius))

Not required:
	
	Spherical chunks borders (for texture scaling) are not perfect (acceptable bug)

BUGS:
	Sometimes camera continue moving backwards/left indefinitely.
	Camera jump when starting to move camera.
	When escaping too soon (before planet is rendered), exception happens (elements not already destroyed when calling cleanup)
	Bug? In updateStates: render() & set UBOs > move models > Copy UBOs to GPU. Problem: UBOs must be set immediatly after render() because, if it's rendered too fast, the model could be rendered before moving models.
	When ESC pressed, a bug arises if modelsToLoad has still models when closing
	Fragment shader (f_planet.frag): Artifact lines
	-Check whether the Y axis in normal maps is correctly fipped upside down (Vulkan maps Y axis inversely than OGL)
	Check that normal maps are correctly put in each face of the planet during Triplanar mapping (I suspect they may not be)
	BUG: PRESS ESCAPE JUST BEFORE RENDERING
	Bug when resizing window (crashes) (and maybe not everything is loaded yet) (Out-of-date/Suboptimal KHR or window resized)
	Make terrain too big makes chunks not to update (maybe because chunk's center is too far)

	Reescalation of textures with distance
	Omit VertexType, VertexPT, and similar things
	Take UV coords out from terrain data
	Create multiple "Renderer::models", one for each layer
	Rotate skybox (with the sun)
	-Fix specular lightning (if wrong) (it illuminates ground before sunrise)
	-Move Light to vertex shader

Rendering:
	- Vertex struct has pos, color, text coord. Different vertex structs are required.
	- Points, lines, triangles
	- 2D graphics
	- Transparencies
	- Scene plane: Draw in front of some rendering (used for skybox or weapons)
	Make classes more secure (hide sensitive variables)
	Parallel loading with many threads.
	When passing vertex data directly, should I copy it or pass by reference? Ok, a ref is passed to Renderer, which passes a ref to modelData, which copies data in a vector, and later in a VkBuffer. Could we avoid the copy in a vector?
	> Many renders: Now, UBO is passed many times, so View and Projection matrix are redundant. 
	> update(): Projection matrix should be updated only when it has changed
	> Generalize loadModel() (VertexPCT, etc.) 
	> Can uniforms be destroyed within the UBO class whithout making user responsible for destroying before creating 
	> Check that different operations work (add/remove renders, add/erase model, 0 renders, ... do it with different primitives)
	X VkDrawIndex instanceCount -> check this way of multiple renderings

	- Allow to update MM immediately after addModel() or addRender()
	- Only dynamic UBOs
	- Start thread since run() (objectAlreadyConstructed)
	- Improve modelData object destruction (call stuff from destructor, and take code out from Renderer)
	Can we take stuff out from thread 2?
	Optimization: Parallel commandBuffer creation (2 or more commandBuffers exist)
	model&commandBuffer mutex, think about it
	Usar numMM o MM.size()?
	Profiling
	Skybox borders (could be fixed with VK_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_MIRRORED_REPEAT)

Useless/Complicated:
	Pass material to Fragment Shader
	Skybox shouldn't require transformation matrices? Just rotating
	TerrainGrid: Use int instead of floats for map key?
	TerrainGrid: Update CB only if new chuncks are required (not only when camera doesn't move)

Abstract:
	> Textures set (share textures)
	> Descriptor set

Model & Data system:
	Each ModelData could have: Vertices, Color buffers, textures, texture coords, Indices, UBO class, shaders, vertex struct
	Unique elements (always): Vertices, indices, shaders
	Unique elements (sometimes): Color buffer, texture coords,
	Shared elements (sometimes): UBO class, Textures, vertex struct(Vertices, color, textCoords)

--- Issues ------------------
Vertex data (vertex, color, texture coords, indices) passed directly to a ModelData object. Problem:
If such data is passed by reference, the user has to wait until the data is loaded after fullConstructor().
If it is passed by value, user don't have to worry.

Constructor sets flag dataFromFile and fullyConstructed
fullConstruction uses dataFromFile
User uses fullyConstructed for knowing how long ModelData needs the data visible 
Alternatively, dont include fullyConstructed, but copy data directly

--- Visual code ------------------
Doesn't detect macros declared in CMakeLists.txt
Doesn't have key combination for "save all"
