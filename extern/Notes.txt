----- glfw ---------------------------------------

In the CMakeLists file, turn the following option OFF in order to get static library: OPTION(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS "Build shared libraries" OFF)

This function only initializes the variable if it is not initialized yet. Otherwise, does nothing (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35744647/disabling-cmake-option-has-no-effect). That's why you have to build glfw first. 

Another option is to replace that command with: SET(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF)

----- Assimp ---------------------------------------

Requires to compile zlibstatic first (an Assimp dependency), and then Assimp.
Add both static libraries (zlib & assimp) to your project.
