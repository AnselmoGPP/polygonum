### VulkanCore

It contains the most basic Vulkan elements necessary for rendering: Vulkan instance (`VkInstance`), surface (`VkSurfaceKHR`), physical device, (`VkPhysicalDevice`), virtual device (`VkDevice`), queues (`VkQueue`), etc.

### VulkanEnvironment

It contains elements necessary for a particular way of rendering and I/O management: `VulkanCore`, command pool (`VkCommandPool`), render pipeline (`RenderPipeline`), swap chain (`SwapChain`), I/O manager (`IOmanager`).

### IOmanager

It's an I/O manager for input (controls) and output (window) operations. It provides:

- `GLFWwindow`: Provides all functionality to this class.
- Input methods (`getKey`, `getMouseButton`, `getCursorPos`, `setInputMode`, `pollEvents`, `waitEvents`).
- Input callbacks (`getYscrollOffset`, `framebufferResizeCallback`, `mouseScroll_callback`).
- Window methods (`createWindowSurface`, `getFramebufferSize`, `getAspectRatio`, `setWindowShouldClose`, `getWindowShouldClose`, `destroy`).

This class also serves as `windowUserPointer` (pointer accessible from callbacks). Each window has a `windowUserPointer`, which can be used for any purpose, and GLFW will not modify it throughout the life-time of the window.

### SwapChain

It contains data relative to the swap chain:

- `VkSwapchainKHR`
- Set of `VkImage` and `VkImageView`.
- Their format (`VkFormat`) and extent (`VkExtent2D`).

### RenderPipeline

It contains a set of `RenderPass` objects. It's a PVF (Pure Virtual Function) that must be configured via overriding (i.e., by creating a subclass that overrides its virtual methods):

- `createRenderPass()`: Create all the `RenderPass` objects. This is done by describing all the attachments (via `VkAttachmentDescription` and `VkAttachmentReference`) for each subpass. 
- `createImageResources()`: Create all the attachments used (`Image` objects). They can be members of the subclass.
- `destroyAttachments()`: Destroy all attachments (`Image` objects).

This class lets you create your own render pipeline such as:

- Forward shading
- Forward shading + post-processing
- Deferred shading (lighting pass + geometry pass)
- Deferred shading + forward shading + post-processing
- etc.

### Image

Image used as attachment in a render pass. One per render pass. It contains:

- `VkImage`
- `VkDeviceMemory`
- `VkImageView`: References a part of the image to be used (subset of its pixels). Required for being able to access it.
- `VkSampler`: Images are accessed through image views rather than directly.

### RenderPass

It contains data relative to a render pass:

- `VkRenderPass`
- Set of `Subpass` objects.
- Pointers to attachments (`VkImageView*`) of each subpass.
- Framebuffer (`VkFramebuffer`) (i.e., set of attachments, including final image) of each subpass.
- etc.

### Subpass

It contains basic subpass data:

- Pointers to input attachments (input images) (`Image*`).
- Number of color attachments (output images).

### Renderer

It manages the graphics engine and serves as its interface. Calling `renderLoop` we start the render loop:

1. `createCommandBuffers`
2. Run worker in parallel (for adding and deleting models)
3. Start render loop:
  1. `IOmanager::pollEvents`: Check for events
  2. `drawFrame`: Render a frame
    1. Take a swap-chain image and use it as attachment in the framebuffer
    2. `update states`
      1. User updates models data via callback
	  2. Pass updated UBOs to the GPU
      3. Update command buffers, if necessary
    3. Execute command buffers
    4. Return the image to the swap chain for presentation
  3. Repeat
4. Worker terminates
5. `vkDeviceWaitIdle`: Wait for `VkDevice` to finish operations (drawing and presentation).
6. `cleanup`

Main contents:

- Variables:

  - `VulkanEnvironment`
  - `IOmanager`
  - `Timer`
  - Models (`ModelData`)
  - Textures (`Texture`)
  - Shaders (`Shader`)
  - `LoadingWorker`
  - Command buffers (`VkCommandBuffer`)
  - Semaphores and fences (`VkSemaphore`, `VkFence`)
  - Global VS and FS UBOs (`UBO`) (max. number of VS UBOs == max. number of active instances)
  
- Methods

  - `renderLoop`: Create command buffer and start render loop.
  - `newModel`, `deleteModel`, `getModel`, `setInstances`
  - `setMaxFPS`
  
  - `getIO`: Get `IOmanager` object.
  - `getTimer`: Get `Timer` object.
  - `getRendersCount`: Number of active instances of a certain model.
  - `getFrameCount`: Number of a certain frame.
  - `getFPS`: Number of Frames Per Second.
  - `getModelsCount`: Number of models in `Renderer::models`.
  - `loadedShaders`: Number of shaders in `Renderer::shaders`.
  - `loadedTextures`: Number of textures in `Renderer::textures`.
  - `getCommandsCount`: Number of drawing commands sent to the command buffer.
  - `getMaxMemoryAllocationCount`: Max. number of valid memory objects.
  - `getMemAllocObjects`: Number of memory allocated objects (must be <= `maxMemoryAllocationCount`)
  
  - `drawFrame`: Wait for command buffer execution, acquire a not-in-use image from swap chain (`vkAcquireNextImageKHR`), update models data, execute command buffer with that image as attachment in the framebuffer (`vkQueueSubmit`), and return the image to the swap chain for presentation (`vkQueuePresentKHR`). If framebuffer is resized, we recreate the swap-chain. Each operation depends on the previous one finishing, so we synchronize swap chain events.
  - `updateStates`: Model data is updated (by user via callback), updated UBOs are passed to GPU, and command buffers are updated (if necessary). 
  - `userUpdate`: Callback for user updates (`void(*userUpdate) (Renderer& rend);`). Mainly used for updating UBOs and adding/removing models.
  - `createCommandBuffers`: Create one command buffer per swap-chain image.

	- `vkBeginCommandBuffer`/`vkEndCommandBuffer`
	- `vkCmdBeginRenderPass`/`vkCmdEndRenderPass`/`vkCmdNextSubpass`
	- `vkCmdBindPipeline`, `vkCmdBindVertexBuffers`, `vkCmdBindIndexBuffer`, `vkCmdBindDescriptorSets`
	- `vkCmdDraw`/`vkCmdDrawIndexed` 
  - `cleanup`: Method called after render loop terminates.
    - `vkQueueWaitIdle`

		- `DestroyDebugUtilsMessengerEXT`
		- `vkDestroySurfaceKHR`
		- `vkDestroyInstance`
		- `IOmanager::destroy`
  - `recreateSwapChain`: The window surface may change, making swap chain no longer compatible with it (example: window resizing). We catch this event, when acquiring/submitting an image from/to the swap chain, and recreate the swap chain. Used in `drawFrame` if `vkAcquireNextImageKHR` (acquire swap-chain image) or `vkQueuePresentKHR` (return image to swap-chain for presentation) output an error.

## How to use

Start by creating a `Renderer` object: Pass a callback of the form `void callback(Renderer& r)` as an argument. This callback will be run each frame. It can be used by the user for updating the Uniform Buffer Objects (model matrices, etc.), loading new models, deleting already loaded models, or modifying the number of renderings for each model. All this actions can be performed inside or outside the callback, but always after the creation of the `Renderer` object.

```
Renderer app(callback);
```

Loading a model: There are different ways of loading a model.

- Specify the number of renders and the paths for the model, texture and shaders (vertex and fragment):

```
modelIterator modelIter = app.newModel( 
    3,
    "../models/model.obj",
    "../models/texture.png",
    "../shadrs/vertexShader.spv",
    "../shadrs/fragmentShader.spv" );
```

- Specify the number of renders, a vector of vertex data (vector<Vertex>), a vector of indices (vector<uint32_t>), and the paths for the texture and shaders (vertex and fragment):

```
modelIterator modelIter = app.newModel( 
    3,
    vertex,
    indices,
    "../models/texture.png",
    "../shadrs/vertexShader.spv",
    "../shadrs/fragmentShader.spv" );
```

Deleting a model: 

```
r.deleteModel(modelIter);
```

Modifying the number of renders of a model:

```
r.setRenders(modelIter, 5);
```

For efficiency, it is good practice to load a model by specifying the maximum number of renderings you will create from it, and during rendering you can modify the number of renders with `addRender()`. Why? Because the internal buffer of UBOs of that model needs to be destroyed and created again each time a bigger buffer requires allocation.

For start running the render loop, call `run()`:

```
app.run();
```

## Technical details

### General system

The Renderer class manages the ModelData objects. Both require a VulkanEnvironment object (the same one).

- **VulkanEnvironment:** Contains the common elements required by Renderer and ModelData (GLFWwindow, VkInstance, VkSurfaceKHR, VkPhysicalDevice, VkDevice, VkQueues, VkSwapchainKHR, swapchain VkImages, swapchain VkFramebuffer, VkRenderPass, VkCommandPool, multisampled color buffer (VkImage), depth buffer (VkImage), ...).
- **ModelData:** Contains the data about some mesh (model), a reference to the VkEnvironment object used, VkPipeline, texture VkImage, texture VkSampler, vector of vertex, vector of indices, vertex VkBuffer, index VkBuffer, uniform VkBuffer, VkDescriptorPool, VkDescriptorSet, etc. The mesh data includes vertex (vertices, color, texture coordinates), indices, and paths to shaders and model data (vertices, color, texture coordinates, indices).
- **Renderer:** Contains all the ModelData objects, and the VkEnvironment object used. Also contains the VkCommandBuffer, Input, TimerSet, a second thread, some lists for pending tasks (load model, delete model, set renders for a model), semaphores, etc. 

### Second thread

When the user 
- loads a model (newModel), a ModelData object is partially constructed and stored in a list of "models pending full construction".
- deletes a model (deleteModel), it is annotated for deletion in a list of "models pending deletion".
- changes the number of renders of some model (setRenders), it is annotated for modification in a list of "models pending changing number of renders".

A secondary thread starts running in parallel just after the creation of a Renderer object. Such thread is continuously looking into these 3 lists. If a pending task is found, it is executed in this thread (so, it's done in parallel): fully construction of a ModelData, destroying a ModelData, or modifying the number of renders of some model. All these operations require modifying the command buffer. Different semaphores control access to different lists, the command buffer, and some common parts of code.

### Others

Models with 0 renders have a descriptor set (like every model) but, since it is supposed to render nothing, the commmand for rendering it is not passed to the command buffer.
